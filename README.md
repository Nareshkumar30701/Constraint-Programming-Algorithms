Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing Implementation

## Objective
In this lab, you will implement two optimization algorithms, Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing, from
scratch to solve the cryptarithmetic puzzle:
SEND + MORE = MONEY

Each letter represents a unique digit from 0 to 9. Your goal is to find the digit each letter represents such that
the sum is correct.

## Hill Climbing Implementation
Hill Climbing is an iterative optimization algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution and makes incremental
changes to improve it until a local optimum is reached.

## Simulated Annealing
Simulated Annealing is an optimization algorithm that mimics the annealing process, where a material is heated
and then slowly cooled to remove defects. It probabilistically accepts worse solutions to escape local optima.
